# Greetings, visitors ðŸ‘‹
A developer at core and high school student from France - I'm Liam.

I mainly program in C#/C++ but also comfortable with plenty of other languages such as Java/JavaScript, Visual Basic, Python, HTML/CSS, Lua and many more.

## 2024: "New Year, New Me"
Isn't it what they say? Anyway, to start off this year, I've rebranded all my accounts to match my [website](https://liam-dev.fr). And most importantly, I will now regularly upload content on it but also on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/lr.devx) and [YouTube](https://youtube.com/lrdevx).

This way, you'll be able to keep track of my progress on different projects, I'm currently working on.

Judging by the number of projects I have and countless things I'd like to do, I sincerely wish I would have twice as much time to actually do everything I want.
